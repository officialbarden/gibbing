[SCHMOOVE II](https://discord.gg/B25MX3D5fG) is a Movement Shooter created by **chopstickwater** on the Minecraft Server [legitimoose.com](https://store.legitimoose.com/). Gibbing (or 'Death Animations') was an original feature introduced to the game by her, where players would explode into small colored blocks (or 'Gibs') when they died. These were physics-based, meaning the direction of the attack would affect the direction in which the Gibs would fly in! Click [here](https://discord.gg/B25MX3D5fG) to Join their Discord.
